# Sales Analytics API - Overview

## Introduction

The Sales Analytics API provides comprehensive access to e-commerce sales data through a powerful query interface. This service is designed to help businesses analyze their sales performance, understand customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Concepts

### Dataset Structure

Our sales dataset contains four main entity types:

1. **Sales Transactions** - Individual purchase records
2. **Products** - Catalog of items being sold
3. **Customers** - Buyer information and demographics
4. **Regions** - Geographic data for location-based analysis

### Query Model

The API uses a flexible query model with three main components:

- **Filters**: Conditions to narrow down the dataset
- **Fields**: Selection of which data to return
- **Aggregates**: Calculations performed on the data

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Sales Performance Analysis
- Track revenue trends over time
- Compare performance across product categories
- Identify top-performing products or regions

### 2. Customer Analytics
- Segment customers by demographics or behavior
- Analyze customer lifetime value
- Identify high-value customer segments

### 3. Inventory Insights
- Monitor product performance
- Identify slow-moving inventory
- Optimize pricing strategies

### 4. Geographic Analysis
- Regional sales performance

- Shipping and logistics optimization

## Data Quality

- **Real-time Updates**: Data is updated every 15 minutes
- **Historical Coverage**: 3 years of historical data available
- **Data Completeness**: 99.2% of records have complete information

## Performance Considerations

- **Query Limits**: Maximum 10,000 records per query
- **Response Time**: Typical queries return in under 2 seconds
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports up to 100 simultaneous queries
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 queries per hour per API key

## Security

- **Authentication**: API key required for all requests
- **Data Privacy**: Customer PII is anonymized in responses
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different data sets
- **Audit Trail**: All queries are logged for compliance
