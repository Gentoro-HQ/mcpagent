# Architecture Overview

This page gives a high-level view of the MCP Agent runtime and how requests flow
through the system.

## High-Level Overview

![Architecture Overview](/images/architecture-overview.png)

Core components shown in the diagram:

- Controllers (HTTP/MCP) expose the MCP HTTP stream endpoint and receive client requests.
- Orchestrator coordinates planning, generation, execution, and evaluation.
- Services include the Knowledge Base (KB) and retrieval, telemetry (OpenTelemetry), and optional TS runtime helpers.
- Model providers integrate with OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and others via a pluggable interface.

## The Three Pillars

### 1) Foundation

The Foundation is the agent’s source of truth. It includes:

- Knowledge Base: Indexed content from `Agent.md`, Markdown docs, and code/API references.
- API Definitions: OpenAPI specs and generated client methods used for grounded tool calls.
- Business Rules: Constraints, policies, and domain-specific logic that shape valid actions.

Together, these assets ground the agent’s reasoning and ensure generated actions map to real, allowed capabilities.

### 2) Agent Behavior

Agent behavior is governed by configuration, typically YAML files, that define:

- Prompts and system guidance for planning and generation
- Guardrails and validation rules (e.g., parameter schemas, rate limits, safety constraints)
- Model attributes such as provider, model name, temperature, and timeouts

These configurations make behavior explicit, versionable, and easy to change without code edits.

### 3) Feedback Loop

Continuous improvement comes from human-in-the-loop feedback and telemetry:

- Review traces, logs, and outcomes to spot issues or inefficiencies
- Capture approvals/corrections on generated plans or code
- Feed learnings back into prompts, rules, or the Foundation assets

This iterative loop steadily improves reliability and task success.

## Execution Workflow

At runtime, requests flow through four main stages:

- Planner: Interprets the goal, consults the Foundation, and proposes a grounded plan and tool sequence.
- Generator: Produces concrete code or API calls (with inputs) to fulfill each step safely.
- Code Executor: Executes generated code or tool calls in a controlled environment; streams results and artifacts.
- Evaluator: Checks outcomes against expectations and guardrails; can request retries, refinements, or human input.

This loop repeats as needed until the goal is met or an error is surfaced with actionable context.
