# Guardrails

Lightweight rules that constrain planning and execution:

- Parameter schemas and required fields
- Domain policies (rate limits, roles, approvals)
- Safety checks before/after tool calls

Configured primarily via YAML and Foundation content; evaluated during plan, generate, and evaluate steps.
