  MCP Agent is a knowledge-driven agent runtime for the Model Context Protocol
  (MCP) that turns natural-language instructions into reliable tool actions with
  dynamic code generation, first-class retrieval, and built-in observability.

# Introduction

## What is MCP Agent?

MCP Agent is a production-ready runtime that lets LLMs operate tools safely and
autonomously. It combines a knowledge base, retrieval, and dynamic code
generation to translate goals into executable actions, while emitting rich
telemetry so you can observe, debug, and improve behavior. It’s model-agnostic
and designed to plug into your stack via the Model Context Protocol.

## The Core Problem it Solves

Designing and wiring tools is tedious: you must define schemas, bind APIs,
manage auth, keep prompts in sync with code, and add logging/tracing that’s
often an afterthought. MCP Agent reduces this toil by indexing your
documentation and APIs, generating the glue code on demand, and standardizing
observability—so developers spend less time hand-crafting integrations and more
time on outcomes.

## Key Features

- Knowledge-driven: indexes Agent.md, docs, and OpenAPI to ground tool use with retrieval.
- Dynamic code generation: synthesizes safe, executable calls and workflows from instructions.
- Built-in observability: OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs for every step and tool call.
- Pluggable models: works with OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and more via a simple provider interface.
