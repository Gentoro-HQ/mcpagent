# Creating a Foundation Folder

Use a local folder as the agent’s source of truth. The agent indexes these files to ground planning and execution.

## Minimal Checklist

- Agent.md — Your high-level agent/system prompt and operating principles
- docs/ — Markdown docs with domain knowledge (optional but recommended)
- apis/ — OpenAPI specs (YAML/JSON) for the services you want the agent to call
- rules/ — Any business rules or constraints (freeform MD/YAML)

## Directory Example
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="foundation" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="Agent.md" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="docs">
      <FileTree.File name="Overview.md" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="apis">
      <FileTree.File name="service.openapi.yaml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="rules">
      <FileTree.File name="policies.md" />
    </FileTree.Folder>  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Run With Your Foundation

Mount your folder at `/var/foundation` so it replaces mocked content:

```bash
docker run --rm \
	-p 8082:8082 \
	-v "${PWD}:/var/foundation" \
	-e APP_ARGS="--process=mock-server --tcp-port=8082" \
	admingentoro/gentoro:latest
```

The agent will index these files on startup and use them during planning, retrieval, and tool execution.
